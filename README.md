Added new bots:
ConCatColumns, NextRowItem, RemoveCharFromString, and StringToStringArray are all data workflows.

1. ConCatColumns: Concatenates column data for each row.
2. NextRowItem: Returns row index and uses this to return next row data.
3. RemoveCharFromString: Removes alpha from string to only return numeric data.
4. StringToStringArray: Splits string into string array and works with arrays in various ways.

GUI Bots
5. Shopper Comparison
6. Travel Warning

Future Bot

If I can find a way to capture Black Friday shopping data then I can make an improved shop bot. We'll see.
